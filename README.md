<h1>Motion Detection Alarm</h1>
This project implements a motion detection alarm system using Python and OpenCV. It starts monitoring the webcam when it is activated and sounds an alarm when motion is detected. It also sends an email notification to the user when motion is detected with few images of the motion. The user can adjust the motion detection sensitivity and the email notification settings.
